Air Quality Prediction Based on Machine Learning
Air Quality Prediction based on Machine Learning
One major basic right is clean air that is integral to the concept of citizenship and it's while not a doubt, the responsibility of every subject to try to do his/her half to stay the air clean. Air quality prognostication has been looked into because the key answer of early warning and management of pollution. During this paper, we tend to propose an Associate in nursing air quality prediction system supported by a machine learning framework known as the sunshine GBM model, to predict air quality. This model, trained victimization lightweight GBM classifier, take meteorology knowledge jointly of sources for predicting the air quality thereby increasing the prediction accuracy by creating full use of obtainable abstraction data. the prevailing air quality observance stations and satellite meteorologic knowledge offer period air quality observance info that is employed to predict the trend of air pollutants within the future. The projected system was found to administer Associate in nursing accuracy of ninety-two.
SYSTEM ANALYSIS
EXISTING SYSTEM:
The existing system aims to predict air quality using machine learning techniques. It utilizes historical air pollutant data collected from sensors and preprocesses the data by cleaning and normalizing it. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets, and feature selection is applied to identify relevant attributes. Various supervised machine learning algorithms, including Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, and Random Forest, are employed to predict air quality levels. The system's architecture involves data extraction, preprocessing, feature selection, training and testing using machine learning algorithms, and prediction. The goal is to develop a model that accurately predicts air quality levels for improved pollution management and public health protection. 
 DISADVANTAGES OF EXISTING SYSTEM:
The accuracy of air quality predictions heavily relies on the quality and coverage of sensor data. If the sensor network is sparse or data quality is poor, it can affect the reliability of the predictions.
Algorithm:SVM,linear regression
PROPOSED SYSTEM:
The proposed system aims to enhance air quality prediction by incorporating advanced machine learning algorithms like Random forest,decision tree ,svm It includes ensemble learning, time-series analysis, and real-time monitoring for adapting to changing data. The system integrates external factors, improves model interpretability, and features a user-friendly interface

ADVANTAGES OF PROPOSED SYSTEM:
By incorporating advanced machine learning algorithms and ensemble techniques, the proposed system can provide more accurate predictions of air quality levels, helping authorities and individuals make informed decisions.
